This is a console-based social media simulation built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. 
It mimics the core functionalities of Facebook, allowing users to create accounts, add friends, post status updates, and interact with other usersâ€”all within a terminal interface. 
Designed as a structured and scalable system, the project implements OOP concepts such as classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to efficiently manage user data and interactions. 
This project serves as a great demonstration of OOP design patterns in a real-world application while showcasing how social networking logic can be implemented in a non-GUI environment.
